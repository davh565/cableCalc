python application that allows for the determination of correct cable sizes based on input parameters
 and determined as per AS/NZS3008 1.1 (Australia)*

*note: primary difference between 3008 1.1 (AU) and 3008 1.2 (NZ) is +10degC ambient temperature assumed
 in 3008 1.1. Using values in 3008 1.1 allows for results to be used in NZ or AU, and provided additional
 de-rating in NZ locations

INPUTS
    per circuit:
        loadKw OR loadAmps
        cable length (m)

        optional: conductor environment (default: partially surrounded by thermal insulation)
                partially surrounded by thermal insulation
                unenclosed, touching
                buried, direct
                other arrangements as per 3008 1.1 section 3 (lower priority)
        optional: ambient temperature (default: 30degC)
        optional: safety factor (default: 1 @ 30degC)
        optional: insulation type (default: X90)

    input values will be xlsx table or csv with input values as above in columns, and diffent circuits in rows 

ALGORITHM
    per circuit:
        IF loadKw provied, convert to loadAmps

        determine requirements based on current-carrying capacity (AS/NZS3008.1.1:2017 2.2(a))
            select tables to use based on insulation type
            apply conductor environment de-rating factor
            apply ambient temperature de-rating factor
            apply safety de-rating factor

        determine requirements based on voltage drop (AS/NZS3008.1.1:2017 2.2(b))
            calculate maximum volt drop permissible based on cable length, loadAmps (Volt drop set to 5% nominal voltage)
            determine volt drop in mV/Am using AS/NZS3008.1.1:2017 Equation 4.2(1)
            select min cable not exceeding above value based on appropriate table (Tables 40-51)
            confirm voltage drop using detailed paramerters based on equation of Claude 4.5*

        determine requirements based on short-circuit temperature limit* (AS/NZS3008.1.1:2017 2.2(c))

OUTPUTS
    per circuit:
        list of suitible cable type/sizes. determined by MINVALUE of current/voltDrop/shortCircuit calcs*
        estimated temperature of each cable**

        *initial revision will spec an example cable of each type/size. Possible expansion in future will
        allow for different model/manufacturers using catalog data
        **not availible in first revision

output format:
    CSV
    XLSX

    output table will include all input data, plus additional columns for temperature/cable size of each solution for given circuit
